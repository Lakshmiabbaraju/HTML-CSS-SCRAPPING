How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? 
Length of a Martian year in Earth days: 687 days.
Length of a Martian sol in Earth days: 1 sol ≈ 1.027 Earth days.
Now, divide the number of Earth days in a Martian year by the length of a Martian sol in Earth days:
Martian Year in Sols=687/1.027=669.2 sols
So, the length of a Martian year is approximately 669.2 sols.
